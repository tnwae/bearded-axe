# Bearded Axe

A couple years ago, my last college project was to write an OpenGL rendering program
in C.  While it worked out great (although the renders didn't look so good since I
suck at shader programming), I've decided to comb through the old code and write a
C++ version that incorporates code by other people.  In particular, I hope to add
support for several mesh formats and to write a better scene description language.
